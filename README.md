GalvanizeU-University of New Haven Master of Science in Data Science - DSCI6051: Data Science Capstone Project

This project consists in building an image classifier for food images for [wellio](http://www/getwellio.com) using convolutional neural networks.

Wellioâ€™s recommendation system allows a user to ask for recipe through a conversational interface. When retrieving the search results Wellio ranks the results using various criteria. Wellio has noticed that their customers tend to choose recipes that are more visually appealing when the results are displayed. Hence, Wellio need to enable the search to also rank on appearance of the recipe.

Product Use Case.
-----------------
As a user I can search for recipes and get back recipes that have appealing images.

Tech Use Case.
--------------
Design an algorithm that classifies images of recipes to appealing/not appealing.
